# Hey, I'm Shawn Tavares 👋

Systems Engineer based in Leamington, ON — 10+ years in enterprise IT, 5 years managing full datacenter infrastructure. I specialize in the Microsoft ecosystem: **Azure**, **Intune**, **Active Directory**, and **PowerShell automation**.

I'm building [North Node Tech](https://northnodetech.ca) — a consulting practice focused on helping businesses modernize, automate, and secure their environments.

## 📦 Featured Projects

### 🛠️ [PowerShell Toolkit](https://github.com/shawnptavares/powershell-toolkit)
Production-tested scripts for IT admins — Intune bulk operations, AD stale object cleanup, SCCM collection management, and a daily-driver profile with tools like `purge` (removes a device from AD, AAD, Intune, Autopilot, and ConfigMgr in one command).

### 💻 [Homelab](https://github.com/shawnptavares/homelab)
A living, documented homelab build — VLAN-segmented network, pfSense firewall, Docker services (Pi-hole, Dashy, Uptime Kuma), and expanding toward Azure Arc integration and centralized monitoring.

### 🔐 AppLocker via Intune *(coming soon)*
A documented breakdown of deploying AppLocker through Intune — policy design, bypass considerations, technician-safe zones, and enterprise enforcement strategies.
