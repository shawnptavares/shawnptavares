# 👋 Hey, I'm Shawn.

I'm a Systems Engineer with over 10 years in IT and 5 years managing full datacenter infrastructure. I specialize in **Azure**, **Intune**, **Active Directory**, and enterprise-grade solutions — and I'm currently transitioning toward **cloud consulting** and **cybersecurity** roles.

I'm passionate about building robust systems, automating tedious tasks, and crafting secure, scalable infrastructure.
